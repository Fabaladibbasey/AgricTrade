					<h3>Agriculture in The Gambia</h3>
					<p>
                        Agriculture is the most important sector in The Gambian economy
                         and one of the priority areas of development, 
                        particularly in the new global climate of price escalation of staple 
                        food items and oil. Agriculture is a major driver of growth in The Gambia. It accounts for approximately 
                        one quarter of GDP and employs 75 percent of the labor force.  In 2017, agriculture contributed approximately 
                        20 percent to GDP of The Gambia’s GDP. Output in the agricultural sectors is growing steadily, however, current output 
                        evels only meet 50 percent of the country’s food needs.
